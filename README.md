# BookBot Project

BookBot is a Python-based project designed to analyze text files by counting both word occurrences and individual character frequencies. The program reads a text file, processes its content, and generates a report highlighting the most frequently used alphabetic characters in descending order of appearance. 

## Features:
- Word count from the input text file
- Character frequency analysis for alphabetic characters
- Generates a detailed report showing occurrences of each character

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- File handling
- Basic string manipulation
- Dictionary-based counting and sorting

This project showcases basic text analysis functionality, I used it to learn fundamental Python programming concepts. This was my first project with Python.
